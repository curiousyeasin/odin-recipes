    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      This easy, cheesy ham and potato casserole uses up leftover Christmas or
      Easter ham! It's perfect for a post-holiday breakfast or weeknight dinner.
      My family looks forward to this classic combination.

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        6 small potatoes, peeled and cut into ½-inch cubes 7 tablespoons butter,
        divided ⅔ pound leftover cooked ham, cut into ½-inch cubes 1 small
        onion, finely chopped 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 ½ cups milk salt
        and ground black pepper to taste 1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar
        cheese ¼ cup bread crumbs
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 1
        ½-quart baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the potatoes are almost finished, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a
        skillet over medium heat. Add ham and onion; cook and stir until the
        onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from
        the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain potatoes; add to the ham mixture and stir to combine. Transfer to
        the prepared baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
        Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light
        golden brown, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually whisk milk into the flour mixture; season with salt and black
        pepper. Continue cooking and stirring until thickened, about 2 minutes.
        Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in Cheddar cheese until melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour cheese sauce over ham and potatoes. Sprinkle bread crumbs over top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and browned, 25 to 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
